# Multi-Channel 1D CNN for Rotatory Machine Fault Classification.
This repository contains code for training and evaluating a multi-channel 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify time series data into multiple classes. The project is organized for clarity and ease of use, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced practitioners in deep learning and time series analysis.

## Project Overview
Mechanical fault classification of rotatory machines by vibration analysis is critical in various domains such as petrochemical, energy, automobile, and engineering. This project implements a multi-channel 1D CNN using PyTorch to classify time series vibration signals into four classes:
* Normal
* Misaligned
* Imbalanced
* Bearing Fault

The model is trained on multi-channel signal data, leveraging convolutional layers to capture temporal patterns and relationships across different channels.
